# Graph Backend Architecture

The Knowledge Graph engine supports multiple backend implementations through a
unified `GraphBackend` abstract interface. All backends provide the same core
capabilities: Cypher query execution, vector search, node/edge CRUD, and
optional SPARQL support.

The **default** backend is the zero-dependency Rust-native `EpistemicGraph`
(`GRAPH_BACKEND=memory`/`file`/`epistemic_graph`); the **production** durable
backend is PostgreSQL (`GRAPH_BACKEND=postgresql`), optionally fronted by the
`tiered` write-through store (L1 EpistemicGraph + L3 Postgres). LadybugDB, Neo4j,
and FalkorDB are first-class backends whose drivers install as optional extras
(`backends/contrib/`).

> **Verified parity (KG-2.7).** Node properties (declared / ad-hoc / nested),
> edge existence, **edge properties**, and vector search round-trip on **every**
> backend; the full cross-backend matrix and how to run it live are in
> [backend-parity-and-profile-testing](../guides/backend-parity-and-profile-testing.md).
> SPARQL is served **locally over any backend** via the OWL/RDF layer (see
> [owl_rdf_layer](owl_rdf_layer.md)).

> **PostgreSQL runs Apache AGE (`GRAPH_PG_AGE=1` / `backend_type=age`).** This
> executes **real openCypher** via AGE's `cypher()` function — `count(r)`,
> `RETURN … AS alias`, multi-hop and variable-length traversal all work natively —
> retiring the bounded regex Cypher→SQL transpiler (still the default when AGE is
> off). pgvector continues to back embeddings. Image: `docker/pg-age.compose.yml`.

## Backend Comparison

| Capability | epistemic_graph (default) | LadybugDB | PostgreSQL (AGE) | Neo4j | FalkorDB |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Status** | **Default (Rust-native)** | first-class (extra) | **Production (durable)** | first-class (extra) | first-class (extra) |
| Cypher Support | subset (id-anchored)¹ | Native (Kuzu) | **Native (AGE)** / transpiled | Native | Native |
| Node props (declared/ad-hoc/nested) | ✅ | ✅ (ad-hoc in `metadata`) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Edge properties** | ✅ | ✅ (JSON `r.properties`) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Vector Search | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ pgvector | ✅ (`:Embeddable`) | ⚠️ AVX2 host² |
| SPARQL (via OWL/RDF layer) | ✅ local | ✅ local | ✅ local | ✅ local | ✅ local |
| Graph Traversal (multi-hop) | compute/L3¹ | ✅ | ✅ (AGE) | ✅ | ✅ |

¹ epistemic_graph is the in-memory **L1 working store**; `backend.execute` interprets
an operational id-anchored Cypher subset, and multi-hop traversal is served via the
compute layer / tiered L3 — by design. ² FalkorDB vector search is code-correct
(Cypher `CREATE VECTOR INDEX` + `db.idx.vector.queryNodes`) but the `falkordb` image
SIGILLs on 768-dim vector ops on non-AVX2 host CPUs.

## PostgreSQL Backend Deep Dive

The PostgreSQL backend combines three PostgreSQL extensions into a unified
graph + vector + search layer:

### Three-Layer Architecture

    subgraph "Layer 1: Storage"
        A["KG-2.0: Node Tables\n(Agent, Tool, Memory, ...)"] --- B["KG-2.0: kg_edges Table"]
    end

    subgraph "Layer 2: Graph Index"
        C["KG-2.0: AGE traversal\n(graph.traverse)\n(graph.shortest_path)\n(graph.search)"]
    end

    subgraph "Layer 3: Search"
        D["KG-2.3: pgvector HNSW\n(Cosine Similarity)"]
        E["KG-2.3: ParadeDB BM25\n(Lexical Ranking)"]
    end

    A --> C
    B --> C
    A --> D
    A --> E
```

### Cypher Transpilation

The engine speaks Cypher; PostgreSQL speaks SQL. The `transpile()` function in
`backends/cypher_transpiler.py` handles the translation for all patterns the
engine generates:

| Engine Cypher | PostgreSQL SQL |
|---|---|
| `MATCH (n:Agent) WHERE n.id = $id RETURN n` | `SELECT * FROM "Agent" WHERE id = $1` |
| `CREATE (n:Tool {id: $id, name: $name})` | `INSERT INTO "Tool" (id, name) VALUES ($1, $2)` |
| `MATCH (s)-[r:PROVIDES]->(t) MERGE ...` | `INSERT INTO kg_edges ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` |
| `MATCH (n) WHERE toLower(n.name) CONTAINS $q` | `SELECT * FROM ... WHERE LOWER(name) LIKE '%$1%'` |
| Path traversal `(n)-[*1..3]-(t)` | `graph.traverse(seed, max_depth:=3)` |

### Extension Dependencies

**Postgres is the durable graph backend of choice here** (`backend: "age"`), and
to be a first-class graph + vector + search store it needs **three** extensions
installed — and, for AGE and pg_search, preloaded:

| Extension | Required | `shared_preload_libraries` | Purpose |
|---|:---:|:---:|---|
| **Apache AGE** (`age`) | **Yes** (for `backend: "age"`) | **yes** | **Native openCypher** — runs the query the engine emits unchanged, so a Postgres connection has `cypher_support = "full"` (parity with Neo4j/FalkorDB). AGE **must** be in `shared_preload_libraries` or it won't load. |
| **pgvector** (`vector`) | **Yes** | no | Embedding storage + HNSW cosine `semantic_search` |
| **ParadeDB** (`pg_search`) | **Yes** | yes | BM25 full-text scoring |
| pg_trgm | Optional | no | Trigram fuzzy text matching |
| pg-age | Optional (legacy) | no | CSR traversal for the regex-transpiler `backend: "postgresql"` path |

> **Why AGE, not just the transpiler.** Without AGE, a Postgres connection falls
> back to the bounded regex transpiler (`backend: "postgresql"`, `cypher_support
> = "subset"`) — fine as a single store, but it cannot serve the full query
> surface a fan-out mirror set shares (CONCEPT:KG-2.74). With AGE, Postgres is a
> peer of Neo4j/FalkorDB and the **preferred authority**.

**The curated image bundles all three.** `services/pg-age/` builds
`registry.arpa/pg-age` **FROM `paradedb/paradedb:latest` (PostgreSQL 18)** — which
already ships `vector` + `pg_search` — and adds **Apache AGE 1.7.0** (the release
that introduced PG18 support). The stack `command` sets
`shared_preload_libraries=pg_search,pg_cron,pg_stat_statements,age` and
`init-extensions.sql` runs `CREATE EXTENSION` for `vector`, `age`, and
`pg_search`. The **stock `paradedb/paradedb` image does NOT include AGE** — using
it directly leaves a Postgres connection on the `subset` transpiler path.

The backend **gracefully degrades** when extensions are missing — CRUD and basic
search work with plain PostgreSQL; native Cypher requires AGE; vector search
requires pgvector; BM25 requires pg_search.

| `GRAPH_FUSEKI_DATASET` | `agent_kg` | Fuseki dataset name |
| `GRAPH_FUSEKI_USER` / `GRAPH_FUSEKI_PASSWORD` | — | Optional Fuseki credentials |
| `KG_CONNECTIONS` | — | JSON list of named connections for the multi-connection registry (CONCEPT:KG-2.63). See below. |

## Multiple Connections at Once (CONCEPT:KG-2.63)

The engine has always been vendor-agnostic, but historically only **one** backend
was live per process. The **named multi-connection registry** lets a deployment
keep several live connections side by side and run the *same* graph tools against
any one — or fan out to all — with the backend choice fully abstracted behind a
`target` parameter. No code is forked into a separate server: every existing
`graph_*` MCP tool and its REST twin gains this for free.

### Register connections

Declaratively, via `KG_CONNECTIONS` (each entry is `create_backend` kwargs plus a
`name`):

```bash
export KG_CONNECTIONS='[
  {"name": "prod-neo4j", "backend": "neo4j", "uri": "bolt://neo4j:7687", "user": "neo4j", "password": "..."},
  {"name": "team-falkor", "backend": "falkordb", "host": "falkor", "port": 6379},
  {"name": "pg-main", "backend": "age", "uri": "postgresql://agent:agent@pg:5432/agent_kg"}
]'
```

…or at runtime via `graph_configure`:

```
graph_configure(action="add_connection", config_key="pg-main",
                config_value='{"backend":"age","uri":"postgresql://agent:agent@pg:5432/agent_kg"}')
graph_configure(action="list_connections")          # per-connection health
graph_configure(action="set_default_connection", config_key="pg-main")
graph_configure(action="remove_connection", config_key="pg-main")
```

### Target a connection

Every `graph_query` / `graph_search` / `graph_write` (and the heavier
`graph_ingest`/`graph_analyze`/`graph_orchestrate`) accepts an optional `target`:

| `target` | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| omitted / `""` / `"default"` | the primary engine — **identical to legacy behaviour** (backward compatible) |
| `"pg-main"` | a single named connection; result shape unchanged |
| `"all"` or `"a,b"` or `["a","b"]` | **fan-out** — per-connection labeled results (`{"targets": {...}, "errors": {...}}`), partial success: one backend failing never aborts the others |

**Writes** only fan out on an *explicit* multi-target value (`"all"`/list) — the
default and a single named target stay single-write, so you never accidentally
triple-write.

### Portability: one query, every backend

For the same Cypher to run unchanged everywhere, the backend must speak native
openCypher. Each backend advertises a `cypher_support` tier:

| Backend | `cypher_support` | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| neo4j, falkordb | `full` | native Cypher |
| **Postgres via Apache AGE** (`backend: "age"`) | `full` | native openCypher (`count(r)`, aliases, multi-hop, `-[*1..2]->`, edge props) + pgvector |
| Postgres regex transpiler (`backend: "postgresql"`) | `subset` | only the bounded operational subset the engine emits; fallback when the AGE extension is absent |
| epistemic_graph (in-memory) | `subset` | interprets the operational subset directly |

**Register Postgres connections as `age`** (not `postgresql`) when you want one
query to run unchanged across neo4j + falkordb + postgres. `list_connections`
reports each connection's `cypher_support` so fan-out callers can tell which
backends can serve a full query.

## Mirror every write to N stores at once (CONCEPT:KG-2.74)

Where KG-2.63 lets you *target* several connections per call, **fan-out** makes
mirroring the **default** for every write: one configurable **authority** store
serves reads and acks writes, and each mutation is replicated — losslessly and
asynchronously — to any set of durable backends. Turn it on with
`GRAPH_BACKEND=fanout`; the zero-infra default is unchanged (it is only built
when you configure a mirror set).

```bash
# Authority = epistemic-graph L1 (fast in-mem reads); mirror to Postgres-AGE,
# Neo4j and FalkorDB. The mirror set names entries declared in KG_CONNECTIONS.
export GRAPH_BACKEND=fanout
export GRAPH_AUTHORITY=epistemic_graph
export GRAPH_MIRROR_TARGETS='["pg-age","prod-neo4j","team-falkor"]'
export KG_CONNECTIONS='[
  {"name":"pg-age","backend":"age","uri":"postgresql://u:p@pg.arpa:5432/agent_kg"},
  {"name":"prod-neo4j","backend":"neo4j","uri":"bolt://neo4j.arpa:7687","user":"neo4j","password":"…"},
  {"name":"team-falkor","backend":"falkordb","host":"falkordb.arpa","port":6379}
]'
```

You may also set the authority to any durable store (e.g. `GRAPH_AUTHORITY=pg-age`)
— whichever connection you name becomes the read source-of-truth, and the rest
are mirrors.

### How it stays lossless

* **Authority commits synchronously; mirrors apply async.** A write returns once
  the authority commits **and** the mutation is durably appended to each mirror's
  outbox. Reads (served from the authority) are always consistent; mirrors are
  eventually-consistent (seconds of lag).
* **Durable per-mirror outbox.** `backends/outbox.py` is a sqlite/WAL append log
  (zero external infra). A per-mirror drainer thread applies entries in order and
  advances a persisted cursor, so a mirror that is **offline or slow keeps its
  unapplied tail and replays from its cursor on reconnect / restart** — a
  transient outage never drops a write. (Contrast the tiered write-behind queue,
  which is in-memory and lost on crash.)
* **One drainer per mirror = natural single-writer.** A file-locked store
  (LadybugDB/Kuzu) is serialised for free — it is simply the slowest mirror.
* **Reconcile backstop.** `graph_configure(action="reconcile")` runs a full
  authority→mirror re-sync and reports exact remaining drift — the repair for the
  only un-mirrorable window (a crash between the authority commit and the outbox
  append) and for a mirror whose outbox tail was lost.

### Operate it

| Surface | Call | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| MCP | `graph_configure(action="mirror_status")` | Per-mirror replication health: `lag`, `writes`, `failures`, `stalled`, `last_error`, plus `outbox_depth`. Alarm on `lag`/`stalled`. |
| MCP | `graph_configure(action="reconcile", config_key="<mirror>")` | Full drift-repair for one mirror (empty `config_key` = all). |
| REST | `POST /graph/configure {"action":"mirror_status"}` | Same core, REST twin. |

**Portability:** use full-openCypher mirrors (Postgres-AGE / Neo4j / FalkorDB) so
the same mutation runs unchanged on every store — see the `cypher_support` table
above.

### Quick Start: PostgreSQL

```bash
# 1. Start the database
docker compose -f docker/pg-age.compose.yml up -d

# 2. Configure the backend
export GRAPH_BACKEND=postgresql
export GRAPH_DB_URI=postgresql://agent:agent@localhost:5433/agent_kg

# 3. Run the graph-os MCP server
graph-os
```

## Implementing a New Backend

1. Inherit from `GraphBackend` in `backends/base.py`
2. Implement all abstract methods: `execute()`, `execute_batch()`, `create_schema()`,
   `add_embedding()`, `semantic_search()`, `prune()`, `close()`
3. Optionally override `supports_sparql` and `execute_sparql()` for SPARQL support
4. Register in the `create_backend()` factory in `backends/__init__.py`
5. Add optional dependency group to `pyproject.toml`
6. Add integration tests

# KG Connectors, Ingestors & Enrichers — the unified ingestion architecture

> **One entrypoint, one provenance contract, one delta model.** Every external
> system the Knowledge Graph knows about — enterprise apps, code, documents,
> research — flows in through the *same* mechanism and is enriched by the *same*
> OWL/RDF reasoning. This is the map of all of them. (CONCEPT:KG-2.9)

This page is the canonical inventory and architecture for how the KG is
**hydrated**. The connector list at the bottom is **auto-generated** from the live
registries (`scripts/generate_connector_map.py`) so it never drifts.

## 1. The one mental model

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph SRC["External systems (~40+ connectors)"]
    EA["Enterprise apps\nLeanIX/ServiceNow/ERPNext/Jira/…"]
    CODE["Code\nGitLab/GitHub repos"]
    PROC["Process\nCamunda/ARIS/Egeria/ArchiMate"]
    DOC["Documents & web\nArchiveBox/crawl4ai/scholarx/search"]
  end

  subgraph CORE["agent-utilities — one ingestion core"]
    SS["source_sync()  ·  sweep_all_sources()\nTHE entrypoint (delta / full / reconcile)"]
    PROV["stamp_source()\nsource_system + domain (provenance)"]
    DELTA["write-layer content-hash delta\nskip unchanged → no write, no re-reason"]
    WB["write_batch / ingest_external_batch"]
  end

  subgraph EG["epistemic-graph (Rust)"]
    PARSE["tree-sitter parse + resolve\nIndexRepository (ast_hash = content hash)"]
    STORE["LPG + Neo4j/FalkorDB/Stardog/pg-age/fanout"]
  end

  subgraph ENR["Enrichers"]
    OWL["OWLBridge reasoning\ntransitive :calls/:dependsOn, crosswalks"]
    EXTR["extractors (code/test, facts, process)"]
  end

  EA & PROC & DOC --> SS
  CODE --> PARSE --> SS
  SS --> PROV --> DELTA --> WB --> STORE
  STORE --> OWL --> STORE
  WB --> EXTR --> STORE
  STORE -->|writeback sinks| SRC
```

Three things are deliberately **uniform** across every connector:

1. **One entrypoint** — `sync_source(engine, source, mode)` (and its fleet-wide
   sibling `sweep_all_sources`). No connector hydrates ad hoc.
2. **One provenance contract** — `stamp_source()` stamps `source_system` +
   `domain` on every row, so named-graph routing, federation, and mirroring treat
   all connectors identically.
3. **One delta model** — see §4.

---

## 2. The standardized surface (3 MCP tools → clear roles)

The Python core was always unified (`sync_source` is "the single entrypoint").
The MCP surface is now standardized to match:

| MCP tool | Role | Delegates to |
|---|---|---|
| **`source_sync`** | **Canonical** connector→KG ingestion. `source=<name>` or `source="all"` (fleet sweep); `mode=delta\|full\|reconcile`. | `sync_source` / `sweep_all_sources` |
| `graph_hydrate` | Back-compat **alias** (full mode). Kept so existing callers don't break. | `sync_source(mode="full")` |
| `graph_ingest` | Different concern: **content** ingestion — paths, URLs, documents, codebases, corpus/job control. Its `sync`/`materialize_source` actions delegate to the same core. | `sync_source` / `run_materialize_source` |

REST twins live under `/api/dashboard/` (`hydrate/{source}`, `hydrate`,
`hydration-status`, `daemon/start`).

**Rule of thumb:** sync a *system* → `source_sync`; ingest a *file/URL/repo path*
→ `graph_ingest`.

---

## 3. The three ingestion paths (how a connector gets in)

A connector participates in one or more of these, dispatched by `sync_source`:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  S["sync_source(engine, source, mode)"] --> A{source in\n_DELTA_HANDLERS?}
  A -->|yes| D["delta handler\nwatermark poll + reconcile\n(leanix / gitlab / archivebox)"]
  A -->|no| B{source in\nMATERIALIZE_SOURCES?}
  B -->|yes| M["run_materialize_source\nvendor client → extractor → write_batch\n(camunda / egeria / okta / …)"]
  B -->|no| C["HydrationManager.hydrate_source\ngeneric full hydrate via CAPABILITY_REGISTRY"]
  D & M & C --> P["stamp_source → content-hash delta → write"]
```

1. **Delta handlers** (`_DELTA_HANDLERS`) — native incremental sync with a
   per-source watermark (`SourceSyncState` node) + reconcile (tombstone upstream
   deletions). The most efficient path.
2. **Materialize extractors** (`MATERIALIZE_SOURCES`) — an in-process vendor
   client + extractor maps the system to BFO/PROV-O entities, persisted via
   `write_batch`, followed by one OWL reasoning cycle.
3. **Capability hydrate** (`CAPABILITY_REGISTRY`) — the generic full-hydrate
   fallback for any registered source that hasn't grown a delta handler yet.

Plus a fourth, document-oriented path: **`MCP_TOOL_PRESETS`** declarative
connectors that pull records/files/search results as Documents through the
generic `McpToolSourceConnector` (used by `graph_ingest`/`build_skill_graph`).

---

## 4. Delta for *every* connector (the optimization)

"Delta-focused ingestion for all connectors" is two layers — and the second is
what makes it universal:

**(a) Fetch-layer watermark** (per-source, opportunistic). Where the source API
supports "changed since", the delta handler stores the max `updatedAt`/
`last_activity_at`/`created_at` on a `SourceSyncState` node and fetches only the
delta next run. Today: LeanIX, GitLab, ArchiveBox.

**(b) Write-layer content-hash delta** (generic, all connectors). At the single
write fan-in (`ingest_external_batch`), every entity gets a stable `content_hash`
over its semantic properties. Before writing, stored hashes are read in **one
batched round-trip** and unchanged entities are dropped — **no MERGE, no
re-reasoning** — *even when the source was fetched in full*. This is what makes a
full re-mirror cheap and turns every connector incremental regardless of whether
its API supports watermarks. Disable with `KG_WRITE_DELTA=0`.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  E["incoming entities"] --> H["content_hash each\n(id + volatile timestamps excluded)"]
  H --> Q["batch read stored hashes\n(MATCH … WHERE n.id IN $ids)"]
  Q --> F{hash changed?}
  F -->|yes / new| W["MERGE + re-reason"]
  F -->|no| K["skip (skipped_unchanged++)"]
```

**Leveraging Rust epistemic-graph.** For code, the content hash is *free*: the
tree-sitter parser already emits a content-stable `ast_hash` and uses it as the
`symbol:<hash>` node id, so "which symbols changed" is answered by node existence
(`HasNodesBatch`) with zero extra compute. `IndexRepository` resolves an entire
repo's `:calls`/`:dependsOn` in one parallel (`rayon`) pass off-reactor. The
generic write-layer delta extends that same content-hash idea to every non-code
connector.

---

## 5. Background ingestion across the board

A single host-role daemon runs `skill_scheduler` every 60s, reading
`deploy/schedules.yml`. The fleet sweep is one declarative entry:

```yaml
- name: all-sources-delta-sweep
  cron: "*/20 * * * *"
  kind: skill
  ref: all          # → sync_source(engine, "all", mode="delta") → sweep_all_sources
  action: delta
  enabled: true
```

`sweep_all_sources(mode="delta")` enumerates the union of delta handlers +
**configured** capability sources + materialize extractors and syncs each,
isolating per-connector failures (unconfigured → *skipped*, not *errored*). With
the write-layer delta, each 20-minute pass is proportional to what changed.
Per-source entries (e.g. a nightly LeanIX `reconcile`, or a tighter cadence for a
hot source) still live alongside it when a source needs its own schedule.

---

## 6. Enrichers (what happens after the write)

Ingestion is only half the story — the KG's differentiator is that everything
lands in **one ontology** and is reasoned over together:

- **OWLBridge reasoning** — transitive `:calls`/`:dependsOn`/`:covers`,
  cross-vendor process crosswalks, `:Feature` clustering; runs as a cycle after
  materialize and on the Loop. (`core/owl_bridge.py`, `ontology_*.ttl`)
- **Extractors** — `code_test` (symbols/tests → `:Code`/`:Test`), the document
  fact extractor (text → atomic fact edges), process lift (Camunda/ARIS → ArchiMate).
- **Writeback sinks** — the outbound half: KG intelligence is pushed *back* into
  the source systems (issues, CMDB CIs, fact-sheet attributes). High-stakes sinks
  are propose-only via the ProposalQueue. (`enrichment/writeback/sinks/`)

## Capabilities

### `ask_data`

**ask data**

answer a DATA question over the Knowledge Graph with a DB-GPT-style, multi-step data-analysis agent (distinct from the single-shot nl_query).

- **Intent verbs:** ask
- **REST route:** `/graph/ask-data`
- **MCP tags:** data-analysis, granular, graph-os, nl, query
- **Side effects:** 0/1 actions matched an EG ledger Method; any_mutates=False; durability=[]; txn=[]
- **Cost/Latency:** unmeasured for this capability (no benchmark source)
- **Reliability:** (unmeasured — no live engine reward reachable at generation time)

**Does:**

- `ask_data` → (no EG ledger match)

**Typed input:**

- `question` (string, required): The natural-language DATA question to answer.
- `dialect` (string): 'auto' (planner chooses, prefers uql) or 'uql'|'cypher'|'sql'|'sparql'.
- `max_corrections` (integer): Bounded self-correction retries after a failed query (0 disables).
- `limit` (integer): Max result rows to return.

**Eligibility predicates:** eligible(candidate, required) = ontology_subsumption(candidate.capability_type, required) AND tenant_match(candidate.tenant, caller.tenant) AND policy_tag_match(candidate.policy_tags, required.policy_tags), ranked by cosine(embedding) + reward_weight*(bandit_reward-0.5)

**Calibrated outcomes:** (empty — no live bandit reward reachable at generation time)

### `concept_registry`

**concept registry**

Atomically claim/list/release concept ids across parallel sessions & worktrees (CONCEPT:AU-OS.governance.atomic-concept-id-reservation). action='reserve' mints the next free id in a namespace (a pillar like 'EG-KG.compute.backend'/'OS-5' or a package prefix like 'KEY') and appends it to the committed, merge=union ledger so two sessions never collide; 'list' shows reservations; 'release' frees one; 'reconcile' marks landed/expired.

- **Intent verbs:** act
- **REST route:** `/concept/registry`
- **MCP tags:** concept, governance, granular, graph-os, ontology
- **Side effects:** 0/1 actions matched an EG ledger Method; any_mutates=False; durability=[]; txn=[]
- **Cost/Latency:** unmeasured for this capability (no benchmark source)
- **Reliability:** (unmeasured — no live engine reward reachable at generation time)

**Does:**

- `concept_registry` → (no EG ledger match)

**Typed input:**

- `action` (string): 'reserve', 'list', 'release', or 'reconcile'.
- `namespace` (string): For 'reserve': pillar ('EG-KG.compute.backend','OS-5') or package prefix ('KEY','GL').

- `design_doc` (string): Optional design-doc path recorded with the reservation.
- `concept_id` (string): For 'release': the id to free.
- `status` (string): For 'list': filter by status (reserved/landed/expired).
- `ttl_seconds` (integer): Reservation TTL before it is reclaimable.
- `repo` (string): Repo root whose ledger to use (defaults to agent-utilities).

**Eligibility predicates:** eligible(candidate, required) = ontology_subsumption(candidate.capability_type, required) AND tenant_match(candidate.tenant, caller.tenant) AND policy_tag_match(candidate.policy_tags, required.policy_tags), ranked by cosine(embedding) + reward_weight*(bandit_reward-0.5)

**Calibrated outcomes:** (empty — no live bandit reward reachable at generation time)

CONCEPT:AU-OS.deployment.vault-seed-service — 'vault_sync' reconciles a service's secrets with the store (read-existing to skip re-prompting + seed new): config_key=service, config_value=JSON {"env_keys":[...],"values":{KEY:VAL},"overwrite":false}; returns {refs:{KEY:"vault://<service>/<KEY>"},present,written,missing} so resolvable vault:// refs drop straight into config.json. CONCEPT:AU-OS.deployment.governance-derived-claude-code — 'harness_fence' writes a governance-derived Claude Code permission fence (settings.json allow/ask/deny + defaultMode=acceptEdits, plus .claudeignore) so the CLI can run unattended safely; config_key=target Claude config dir (default ~/.claude), config_value optional {"policy":<ActionPolicy yaml>,"dry_run":true}; the deny list is regenerated from the live ActionPolicy each run. 'schema_pack' with config_key=<name> sets the active domain Schema Pack, or with empty config_key returns the active pack plus available packs; 'schema_candidates' reviews out-of-pack types seen on write (CONCEPT:AU-KG.ontology.schema-pack-lifecycle-audit). CONCEPT:AU-KG.backend.multi-connection-registry — 'add_connection' registers a named graph backend (config_key=name, config_value=JSON spec e.g. {"backend":"neo4j","uri":"bolt://...","user":"...","password":"..."}; use backend 'age' for Postgres native openCypher; CONCEPT:AU-KG.backend.connection-registry — spec may set role 'read'(default, query-only data source)|'read_write'|'mirror', and password/user/uri may be a vault://path or env://VAR ref; the connection is persisted to config.json so it survives restart); 'remove_connection' (config_key=name); 'list_connections' returns per-connection health + role; 'set_default_connection' (config_key=name) repoints the default target. 'profile_connection' (config_key=name) read-only-introspects a registered external graph's schema (labels, relationship types, property keys, per-label counts + sample property shapes); 'imprint_connection' profiles it, maps each external label onto our ontology (interfaces + our node types; unmatched flagged 'novel'), and writes a self-describing ExternalGraphReference catalog node (no credentials) into the authority KG so the foreign graph becomes discoverable+usable. CONCEPT:AU-KG.backend.mirror-health-repair — 'mirror_status' returns per-mirror replication health (lag/failures/stalled) for a GRAPH_BACKEND=fanout deployment; 'reconcile' (optional config_key=<mirror name>, empty=all) runs a full authority→mirror drift-repair pass. 'setup_databases' provisions the Stardog + pg-age environment end-to-end (config_key=profile 'dev'|'prod', config_value=JSON options e.g. {"postgres_mode":"managed_image","dsn":"postgresql://...","sparql_target":"builtin"}); 'verify_databases' probes a Postgres for the age/vector/pg_search extensions (config_key or config_value.dsn = DSN). CONCEPT:AU-KG.query.stardog-instance-data — Stardog instance-data sync (push/pull/query of real KG data, distinct from the ontology/TBox): 'push_to_stardog' writes KG nodes+edges into Stardog, partitioned into urn:source:<system> named graphs (config_value optional {"sources":["leanix","servicenow"],"connection":<registered name>} — omit sources to push everything; resolves a Stardog backend from config_key/connection name or inline {"endpoint","database","username","password"} or STARDOG_* env); 'pull_from_stardog' re-ingests Stardog data back into the KG (config_value optional {"source":"leanix"} or {"graph_uri":"urn:source:..."} to scope to one named graph, {"limit":N}); 'stardog_sparql' runs a SPARQL SELECT/ASK/CONSTRUCT/UPDATE against Stardog (config_value={"query":"SELECT ..."} or a bare query string). For continuous live replication instead, register Stardog as a role='mirror' connection (add_connection {"backend":"stardog",...}) under GRAPH_BACKEND=tiered/fanout and use 'reconcile' to backfill. 'generate_config' writes a COMPLETE profile-seeded config.json covering every option (config_key=profile 'tiny'|'single-node-prod'|'enterprise', config_value optional {"out":path,"redact_secrets":true}); 'config_doctor' validates a deployment's config completeness/health (config_key=profile, config_value optional {"config":path}); 'config_reference' returns every option grouped by subsystem. CONCEPT:AU-KG.backend.connection-registry — 'get_config' (config_key=env name) returns a live value; 'set_config' (config_key=env name, config_value=scalar or JSON) validates against config_reference, persists to config.json + applies live, and flags 'restart_required' for engine-rebuild settings; 'list_config' returns every current value (secrets redacted). 'system_doctor' runs a holistic deployment health sweep (brew/flutter-doctor style) across config/engine/backend/secrets/auth/mcp-fleet/hooks/observability, each with a remediation + skill (config_value optional {"only":[...],"fix":true,"live":true}). 'preflight' checks whether THIS HOST has the runtimes/tools to deploy a profile BEFORE installing (Python 3.11-<3.15, uv/pip, the epistemic-graph engine binary — Rust only as a fallback, Docker when not the tiny profile, and per-component deps): config_key=profile 'tiny'|'single-node-prod'|'enterprise', config_value optional {"components":["agent-webui","geniusbot","agent-terminal-ui"]}.
- `config_key` (string): The key or ID of the configuration/secret (for 'schema_pack', the pack name e.g. 'research-state'; for connection actions, the connection name).
- `config_value` (string): JSON string containing the payload or secret value.

### `graph_feedback`

'ingest_url' content-aware single-URL ingest (CONCEPT:AU-KG.research.skill-graph-distillation): target_path=URL → fetch via the unified resolver (ArchiveBox→crawl4ai→requests) into a Document, and for a research roundup (auto-detected, or forced with description='extract_papers' / disabled with 'no_papers') download the cited papers via scholarx and ingest them too, linking page→paper; runs inline. 'archivebox_sync' pulls preserved ArchiveBox snapshots into the KG (corpus_name='full' = pull ALL, else delta; base_path=JSON list of snapshot ids to select). 'skill_workflows' ingests the universal-skills workflow corpus (workflows/<domain>/<name>/SKILL.md) into the KG as dispatchable WorkflowDefinition DAGs (+WorkflowStep depends_on edges +USES_SKILL links) in the exact WorkflowStore shape execute_workflow reads, so kg-delegate / graph_orchestrate execute_workflow can discover and fire them; target_path optionally overrides the corpus root, default=installed universal_skills package; idempotent (content-addressed re-ingest is a no-op); runs as a BACKGROUND job (returns a job_id immediately — the full corpus takes ~150s, over the call ceiling — poll with action=job_status job_id=<id>). 'materialize_source' runs an enterprise source extractor (corpus_name=category, e.g. 'camunda'/'aris'/'egeria'; description=optional JSON extractor config), persists its BusinessProcess/BusinessTask/FLOWS_TO batch into the graph via an in-process vendor client, then runs one OWL reasoning cycle so the new process structure folds into the cross-vendor crosswalk. 'fact_extract' turns a document (description=raw text, or target_path=file) into atomic (subject)-[predicate]->(object) fact edges with confidence/evidence/tags, dedups them, persists to the graph, and returns the facts + JSONL. 'extract_submit'/'extract_jobs'/'extract_status'/'extract_pause'/'extract_resume'/'extract_jsonl' run extraction as a GPU-slot-scheduled job (preempt/backfill/resume on the single GPU) addressed by job_id; max_depth sets rounds. 'distill' exports a KG subgraph to a portable skill-graph (target_path=out dir; corpus_name=seed node id OR description=query; max_depth=hop depth). 'import_pack' re-ingests a distilled skill-graph dir back into the KG (target_path=dir; corpus_name='dedup' to merge duplicates). 'build_skill_graph' runs the UNIFIED skill-graph pipeline (CONCEPT:AU-KG.research.skill-graph-distillation): acquire from ANY source kind into one standardized skill-graph (corpus_name=name; target_path=output parent dir; base_path=JSON list of sources [{kind,uri,options}] OR 'kind=uri,kind=uri' shorthand over web/pdf/office/dir/url_reader/rest/database/mcp_tool/generated/kg_query; description=optional human description) — always writes the offline corpus + a sources.json provenance/freshness manifest, and ALSO ingests into the KG when the daemon is reachable (degrades cleanly otherwise). 'skill_graph_status' reports freshness of an existing skill-graph (target_path=dir; corpus_name='quick' to skip network sources). 'rebuild_skill_graph' re-acquires from the recorded sources and bumps the version (target_path=dir). Queue control: 'cancel' (job_id), 'clear' (target_path=status filter pending|running|completed|failed|cancelled|zombie|all, default completed), 'prioritize' (job_id, target_path=high|normal). Research evolution (CONCEPT:AU-KG.ingest.batch-research-cohort): 'cohort_create' (base_path=JSON list of paper URLs, target_path=JSON list of repo paths, description=goal) batch-ingests a cohort of papers+repos whose self-polling barrier synthesizes the comparative feature/innovation matrix (KG-2.173) when every member drains; 'cohort_status' (job_id=cohort_id) returns per-member progress + the matrix counts; 'profile' (corpus_name=lane|type|tkind, CONCEPT:AU-OS.observability.per-lane-latency-metrics) returns per-lane/stage latency percentiles + token/cost + the parallelism factor.
- `job_id` (string): ID of the job to check status for.
- `corpus_name` (string): Name of the corpus to add/update.
- `base_path` (string): Base path for the corpus.
- `description` (string): Description of the corpus.
- `content_type` (string): Internal override only — leave empty. The content type (codebase, document, config, prompt, skill, mcp_server, kb, conversation, policy) is auto-detected from the path, and heavy types (codebase/document) always run on the async job queue. Only set this to force a specific category for an ambiguous path.

- `target` (string): CONCEPT:AU-KG.backend.multi-connection-registry — named graph connection to write to (default = primary). Use a registered connection name, or 'all' (or a comma-separated list) to mirror the SAME write to several backends. Fan-out requires an explicit multi-target value; the default and a single named target stay single-write.
- `conditions` (object): For action='compare_and_set': field→expected-value the node must currently match for the update to apply (a missing field reads as null). e.g. {'status': 'pending'}.
- `updates` (object): For action='compare_and_set': field→new-value to merge into the node ONLY when every condition matches. e.g. {'status': 'claimed', 'owner': 'agent-7'}.

### `spec_ticket`

**spec ticket**

Link a KG SDD spec/feature to a Plane/Jira work item and make agents assignable (CONCEPT:AU-KG.ingest.enterprise-source-extractor). action='link' (push spec content onto the item, link it, assign to user/agent/act-as-user, comment) or 'pull' (read items assigned to a user — 'what do I own?').

- **Intent verbs:** write
- **REST route:** `/spec/ticket`
- **MCP tags:** granular, graph-os, ontology, sdd, writeback
- **Side effects:** 0/1 actions matched an EG ledger Method; any_mutates=False; durability=[]; txn=[]
- **Cost/Latency:** unmeasured for this capability (no benchmark source)
- **Reliability:** (unmeasured — no live engine reward reachable at generation time)

**Does:**

- `spec_ticket` → (no EG ledger match)

**Typed input:**

- `action` (string): 'link' or 'pull'.
- `target` (string): 'plane' or 'jira'.
- `spec_json` (string): For action='link': the spec dict {feature_id,title,user_stories,...}.
- `issue_id` (string): The Plane work-item id / Jira issue key.
- `project_id` (string): Plane project id (for plane).
- `assignee` (string): Explicit user id to assign.
- `agent` (string): Agent id to assign (maps via AGENT_USER_MAP).
- `comment` (string): Optional comment to post.
- `user` (string): For action='pull': user whose items to read.
- `dry_run` (boolean): Preview without writing (default).

**Eligibility predicates:** eligible(candidate, required) = ontology_subsumption(candidate.capability_type, required) AND tenant_match(candidate.tenant, caller.tenant) AND policy_tag_match(candidate.policy_tags, required.policy_tags), ranked by cosine(embedding) + reward_weight*(bandit_reward-0.5)

**Calibrated outcomes:** (empty — no live bandit reward reachable at generation time)

### `usage_query`

**usage query**

Query usage/cost/observability analytics (CONCEPT:AU-ECO.mcp.usage-cost-observability-surface): token counts, cost, model/tool/skill/db-call usage, session browser, activity heatmap, full-text search, and Langfuse trace links.

- **Intent verbs:** write
- **REST route:** `/usage/query`
- **MCP tags:** granular, graph-os, observability, usage, write_ingest
- **Side effects:** 0/11 actions matched an EG ledger Method; any_mutates=False; durability=[]; txn=[]
- **Cost/Latency:** unmeasured for this capability (no benchmark source)
- **Reliability:** (unmeasured — no live engine reward reachable at generation time)

**Does:**

- `activity` → (no EG ledger match)
- `by_agent` → (no EG ledger match)
- `by_model` → (no EG ledger match)
- `by_project` → (no EG ledger match)
- `search` → (no EG ledger match)
- `series` → (no EG ledger match)

- `sessions` → (no EG ledger match)
- `summary` → (no EG ledger match)
- `tools` → (no EG ledger match)
- `top_sessions` → (no EG ledger match)

**Typed input:**

- `action` (string): summary | by_model | by_project | by_agent | tools | activity | sessions | session_detail | top_sessions | search | traces | series
- `from_date` (string): ISO start (started_at >=).
- `to_date` (string): ISO end (started_at <=).
- `project` (string): Filter by project.
- `agent` (string): Filter by agent type.
- `model` (string): Filter by model.
- `origin` (string): ingested | runtime (omit for both).
- `tenant_id` (string): Tenant scope.
- `session_id` (string): For action=session_detail.
- `query` (string): For action=search (FTS).
- `limit` (integer): Row cap for list actions.

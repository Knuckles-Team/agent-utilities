"""Stateless agent dispatch worker — the ``agent-dispatch`` consumer fleet.

CONCEPT:ORCH-1.45 — Queue-driven agent dispatch with session-keyed partitions
consumed by a stateless dispatch-worker fleet (sibling of the KG-2.57
``kg-ingest`` worker — same skeleton, same delivery contract):

* **Any host** can run ``agent-dispatch-worker`` processes. They consume
  :class:`~agent_utilities.orchestration.agent_dispatch.AgentTurnEnvelope`
  messages from the ``agent_turns`` queue (Kafka consumer group
  ``agent-dispatch``, or the Postgres/SQLite claim equivalents), rehydrate the
  referenced goal/session/job from the shared OS-5.16 state store, and execute
  through the EXISTING execution paths — ``core.sessions.run_goal_loop`` for
  goal runs, the orchestration manager's agent execution for orchestrator
  jobs. Nothing is duplicated; the worker only relocates WHERE those bodies
  run.
* **At-least-once + idempotent claims.** The queue ack/offset-commit happens
  strictly AFTER a turn finishes (or is durably marked failed). A worker crash
  redelivers the envelope (Kafka rebalance / Postgres visibility timeout /
  SQLite head-until-ack); the claim check then skips terminal jobs and
  re-claims jobs whose previous claim went stale — crash recovery without a
  separate scheduler (the reaper pattern, folded into the claim).
* **Per-session mutual exclusion.** Claims and execution run inside
  :func:`~agent_utilities.orchestration.agent_dispatch.session_execution_guard`
  (process-local lock + fleet-wide Postgres advisory lock), so even a
  redelivery racing the original consumer can never execute one session
  twice concurrently — the correctness contract for turn coherence.
* **Engine clients.** Like the ingest workers, dispatch workers force
  ``KG_DAEMON_ROLE=client`` (CONCEPT:OS-5.14 auth applies) and never contend
  for the KG host flock.

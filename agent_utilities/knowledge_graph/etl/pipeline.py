"""Unified ETL pipeline — one source→transform→sink interface (CONCEPT:AU-KG.ontology.one-source).

A thin orchestrator that collapses the KG's existing bidirectional machinery into a
single "move data between systems" entrypoint. It writes no transport of its own —
it composes the parts that already exist:

* **Extract + transform + load (inbound):** ``core.source_sync.sync_source`` runs the
  registered extractor/hydrator for ``source`` (LeanIX, ServiceNow, Egeria, Camunda,
  …); the ontology layer (interfaces / links / OWL bridge) is the transform, turning
  each external schema into the KG's canonical model. The KG is the canonical hub.
* **Load (outbound):** dispatch ``sink`` by kind —
  - a **WritebackSink** domain (leanix/servicenow/egeria/…) → ``run_writeback`` (the KG
    pushes intelligence back to the system of record; dry-run-first + ProposalQueue);
  - a **graph store** (Stardog/Neo4j/AGE/…, passed as a resolved ``sink_backend``) →
    full-data load: ``stardog_sync.push_to_stardog`` for a SPARQL store (partitioned
    into ``urn:source:<system>`` named graphs), else ``migration.copy_graph``.
* **Lineage:** every run is recorded via :mod:`.lineage` for impact analysis.

So ``run_etl(source="servicenow", sink="leanix")`` is ServiceNow → (ontological
normalization in the KG) → LeanIX; ``source="leanix", sink="stardog"`` mirrors LeanIX
into Stardog; either side may be omitted for a one-directional run. ``run_etl`` stays
pure (no MCP/registry import) — the caller resolves ``sink_backend``.
